🔍 Model Summary: Electricity Bill Prediction
==============================

📌 Objective:
To build a supervised machine learning model that predicts the monthly electricity bill based on appliance usage, tariff rate, usage hours, and location-specific details like city and energy provider.

📊 Dataset Overview:
- Features: Appliance counts, Monthly usage hours, Tariff Rate, City, Company
- Target: ElectricityBill
- Categorical features encoded using Label Encoding
- Numerical features scaled using StandardScaler
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing

==============================
📈 Models Evaluated:
==============================
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision Tree Regressor
5. Random Forest Regressor ✅
6. Gradient Boosting Regressor
7. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

==============================
🏆 Best Performing Model:
==============================
Model: Random Forest Regressor  
Reason: Achieved the lowest RMSE and highest R² score on the test data.

✅ RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):  5.3276  
✅ R² Score:                        1.0000

==============================
📌 Remarks:
==============================
- Random Forest captured non-linear relationships and feature interactions better than linear models.
- Tree-based models handled categorical encodings effectively without overfitting.
- SVR performed poorly due to sensitivity to feature scaling and smaller dataset size.

==============================

Visualizations and interpretation are shown before and after modeling.
