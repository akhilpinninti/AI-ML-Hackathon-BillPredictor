# ðŸ”Œ Electricity Bill Prediction â€” AI/ML Hackathon

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement
With growing energy demands, accurate forecasting of electricity bills is crucial for both users and providers. This project aims to build a traditional machine learning model that predicts the **monthly electricity bill** based on:

- Appliance counts (Fan, Refrigerator, AC, etc.)
- Monthly usage hours
- Tariff rate
- City and energy provider

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a **supervised regression model** that predicts the `ElectricityBill` value using a combination of numerical and categorical input features.


---

## ðŸ§ª Models Used
We evaluated several traditional machine learning models:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree
- **Random Forest** âœ… (Best)
- Gradient Boosting
- SVR

---

## âœ… Best Performing Model
**Random Forest Regressor**

Selected based on:
- ðŸ”¹ Lowest RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- ðŸ”¹ Highest RÂ² Score on test data

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score
